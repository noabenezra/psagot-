    "details": "The Pritchett-Dunphy-Tucker clan is a wonderfully large and blended family with Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neil) sitting at the head. By his side is his vivacious, younger second wife, Gloria (Sofia Vergara), and together they are navigating life with their youngest son, Joe, and Gloria's son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez), who is heading off to college to explore the world on his own terms. Meanwhile, Jay's grown daughter, Claire (Julie Bowen), and her husband, Phil (Ty Burrell), are learning to navigate life as empty-nesters with the youngest, Luke (Nolan Gould), now out of high school and looking to his next move; middle daughter Alex (Ariel Winter) is learning how to balance academia and a social life, and eldest Haley (Sarah Hyland) is still living at home as she pursues a career and love. Then there's Claire's brother and Jay's grown son, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), and his husband, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), who are about to enter the dreaded middle-school years with their newly discovered, gifted daughter, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons). These three families are unique unto themselves, and together they give us an honest and often hilarious look into the sometimes warm, sometimes twisted, embrace of the modern family."
